PyNamecheap
===========

Limited Namecheap API client in Python

Currently supports:
 - Checking domain name availability
 - Listing domains you have registered
 - Getting contact information for a domain

Planned next:
 - Actually registering a domain
 - Adding tests

This will not be a complete client, as personally I only need the ability
to register domains with it (especially whoisguard, domain transfers will
likely never be implemented). After it gets there, development will stop 
(unless you want to contribute).
