PyNamecheap
===========

Namecheap API client in Python.

Supports:
 - Registering a domain
 - Checking domain name availability
 - Listing domains you have registered
 - Getting contact information for a domain
 - Setting DNS info to default values
 - Set DNS host records

How to start using the API
###

The API has two environments, production and sandbox. Since this API will spend real money when registering domains, start with the sandbox by going to http://www.sandbox.namecheap.com/ and creating an account. Accounts between production and sandbox are different, so even if you already have a Namecheap account you will need a new one.
